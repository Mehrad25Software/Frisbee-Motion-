# Frisbee Motion: Distance prediction based on launch angle

## I.Topic Presentation

The idea behind this physics project is to study the maximum distance that a frisbee can travel in a constant enviornment and initial position, but with different angles. A frisbee is a concave plastic disk designed for skimming through air.
## II.Physical Concepts

A frisbee has always a quadratic trajectory, its trajectory depends on different variables: the shape of frisbee and its mass, launch position, launch speed and launch angle. In this case the study of its trajectory is based on the launch angle of attack. Depending on its angle it will reach a maximum height and a maximum distance.

## The angle

the angle of attack is defined by alpha (α) the inclination angle of frisbee is defined by beta (β) and the angle of velocity vector is defined by theta (θ). the formula for angle is : α=β-θ
the assumption is that the trajectory of a frisbee changes based on the initial position on x and y axis. In our project we decided to predicted the maximum distance traveled by a frisbee when is launch at x axis on 0 and y axis at 1:(0,1).

## The Question

We are going to write a code that generates the trajectory of a frisbee with air resistance. With a certain set of initial conditions, we will determine which angle of attack generates the largest range for the frisbee.
